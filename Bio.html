		<h1>Bio</h1>
		<p>
			They met on campus where we all went to school. The bassist, Jamie, was performing on the university commons every day. 
			One day, Dylan, the guitarist decided to surprise him by joining him. It was a hug hit, there were more and more 
			people that would come to see them perform everyday. Eventually, Raf, the now lead singer, went up to them one 
			day and told them flat out: "I have lyrics for you." Never before had they truly thought of adding lyrics to
			any of their little melodies. After hearing what Raf had, and that he was a fanominal singer, they added him to 
			the group. All they had left to start a band was a drummer. Thats where	Sylvestor came in. The band was complete.
		</p>
		<p>
			The name "Pop goes the weasel" came from their love of pop music and the joy all of them would get from playing with
			the jack in the box toy that you wind up then would pop out at the end of the song.
